# TensorFlow Based Deep Machine Learning (DML) For Power System Analysis

## System Architecture

InterPSS DML system includes three main components:

* **Google [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) DML engine**

TensorFlow is an open source software library by Google for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs. See the [Installation and Configuration](https://github.com/interpss/DeepMachineLearning/wiki/Runtime-Env-Setup#installation-and-configuration) page for instructions to install and configure TensorFlow on a Windows environment.   

* **InterPSS Power System Analysis Model Service**

* **Pluggable Training Data Generator**
